				<p>These are my values I stick to in my creative works. In a no way, shape, or form it's a dogma that everyone must adhere to. It's just for my own self. If you like this manifesto, you are free to use it and link it on your website!</p>
				<br>
				<h2>So, my eight artistic principles</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Creation is a result of meticulous observation. A great artist is a great viewer.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Art is an exploration of life, sensations, and relationships. It is like a natural science on its own—it studies, makes experiments, and helps us understand and live the life to the fullest.</li>
						<br>
						<li>All forms of art are equal, no kind of art is right or wrong. The artist is not limited to a certain, 'more valid' goal, theme, medium, style, etc—there's no such thing. Art can amaze, mock, cheer up, sadden, intrigue, scare, arouse, disgust, inspire, disappoint, support, call to question, be a fairytale, be dystopian, and much more. It can be uncanny and whimsical, or mundane and hyperrealistic. It's free to express all multifacetedness of consciousness.</li>
						<br>
						<li>All art is art, as long as it's made by sentient beings, no matter the purpose. Art too can be ulterior, and we need to remember that to not fall prey to the notion that we are 'better' people because we make 'good' and 'real' art. Our perception could be distorted as non of us are infallible and immune to propaganda, and we, as artists, need to constantly reflect on our core values to prevent any harm.</li>
						<br>
						<li>No one must ever be shunned and barred to entry the art sphere. Disability, poverty, or lack of skill are aspects of sentience and thus of art.</li>
						<br>
						<li>As art expresses sentience, no machine is able to recreate art.</li>
						<br>
						<li>The greatest value of art is the process of creating it.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Art must be redefined not as a commodity or worse—a luxury,—but as a common good. It is best to share art freely for everyone to experience, whenever possible.</li>
					</ol>
				<br>
				<p><b>To sum up: observe, explore, reflect, share, and don't judge.</b></p>
				<br>
				<p>I'd like to know your opinion or your own principles! It'd help me to elaborate on these ideas if necessary.</p>
