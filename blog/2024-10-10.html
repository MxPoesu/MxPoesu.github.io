				<p>This page is a work in progress more than any page of this website! Degoogling ain't easy at all and doesn't happen overnight. But I find joy in the process as I realize how much more cozy my devices now are. It made me more attentive. There's some beauty in replacing one app with a bunch that I cannot yet describe. Mayhaps the smaller and more specific a tool is, the more it is thoughtful and genuine? Human-scale, I guess.</p>
				
				<br>
				
					<h2>Successful replacements</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><b>Play Store</b> — F-Droid with additional repos (IzzyOnDroid, Bitwarden, Thunderbird).</p>
							</li>
					
							<li>
								<p><b>Photos</b> — Fossify Gallery + Open Video Editor. Personally I don't need a cross-platform app and sync here, I transfer photos via USB. I never relied on syncing, because I'm annoyed I don't have full control over how files present themselves (I love folders and bulk renaming with FastStone Image Viewer).</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Pay (Wallet?)</b> — Catima.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Calendar</b> — Literally a physical calendar hanging on the wall.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Files</b >— Material Files.</p>
							</li>
			
							<li>
								<p><b>Gboard</b> — HeliBoard.</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<p><b>Keep</b> — Nextcloud (Murena as a provider) + Quillpad (Android), Joplin and Notepad++ with MarkdownViewer++ plugin (PC). I was initially looking for a cross-platform app, but realized I could just sync .txt files instead. Murena sucks though and is constantly unavailable, rendering syncronization impossible. I guess I'll have to learn how to self-host.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					
					<h2>Partially successful, still needs work</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>
								<p><b>Drive</b> — Nextcloud, ProtonDrive. Alternatives don't offer much storage, so I can't put a lot of stuff there. Currently use them to transfer small things from PC to smartphone and vice versa, and backup crucial files.</p>
							</li>
					
							<li>
								<p><b>Gmail</b> — ProtonMail, Thunderbird (PC), K-9 (Android). It's a bummer PM doesn't let users to use their bridge and PC app without a subscription. I basically use Gmail for signing up and not sending emails, so maybe it's fine as long as it's just a spam mail storage, lol.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Docs and Sheets</b> — LibreOffice (offline, PC). Can't find an alternative, especially an ecosystem type, that doesn't suck ass visually <i>and</i> can sync files across my devices.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Chrome</b> — Brave, sometimes TOR, Opera (Android). Not satisfied that I'm still on chromium-based browsers.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>Search engine</b> — DuckDuckGo + uBlacklist add-on, Marginalia. Have to occasionally use Yandex (yet another big tech corpo…) for searching by image. It's damn good at it. Also I hate DuckDuckGo shoving the AI assistant down my throat.</p>
							</li>
						
							<li>
								<p><b>YouTube</b> — FreeTube (PC). Unsure if it counts, 'cuz it still relies on YouTube but focuses on privacy and user-friendliness. I rarely need YouTube on my phone.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
