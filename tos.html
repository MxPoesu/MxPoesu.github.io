				<p>By commissioning an artwork you agree to the terms of service stated below.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>DONT'S:</b></p>
					<p>‚õî minors</p>
					<p>‚õî severe gore</p>
					<p>‚õî sketches (I only do fully colored artworks)</p>
					<p>‚õî imitation of someone else's style</p>
					<p>‚õî anything having to do with AI or NFT</p>
				<p>Everything else goes (most likely)</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>50% PAID</b> after the rough sketch is finished and agreed upon. The rest is paid before I send you a scan of the finished artwork. 
					Payments accepted only via this <a href="https://hipolink.me/mx.poesu">Hipolink page</a>. 
					Unfortunately I can't use any other platforms. Due to the same technical reasons refunds are not available.
					Don't send me the payment before I've requested you to do so. Otherwise I'll consider it a donation.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>REVISIONS:</b></p>
					<p>üìÑ rough sketch: unlimited, if general idea doesn't change</p>
					<p>‚úèÔ∏è pencil lineart: 2 revisions for free, only insignificant edits allowed; 
					further revisions charged from $1 depending on the amount of work needed</p>
					<p>üé® colouring and acrylic lineart: not allowed, because edits at this stage are either too difficult, 
					or impossible since I'm a traditional artist</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>SHIPPING</b> price is not included and may vary depending on your location and size of the artwork. </p>
				<br>
				<p><b>COMMERCIAL USE</b> negotiable. By default no commercial use rights are given. 
					I retain all rights over the artwork, including the right to post it publicly. 
					I don't do private commissions that I'm not allowed to publish on my own, 
					but I can put the post on hold if your commission is a gift for someone. 
					You are free to post the final artwork publicly.</p>
				<br>
				<p><b>NO GENERATIVE AI</b> used or will ever be used at any stage of my art process, 
				including conception, references, processing, etc. I will not accept AI 'art' as a reference picture. 
				I prohibit usage of my art in any proximity to generative AI and NFTs.<p>
