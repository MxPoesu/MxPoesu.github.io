			<p>
				By commissioning an artwork you agree to the terms of service stated below.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>DONT'S:</b></p>
			<p>⛔ minors</p>
			<p>⛔ severe gore</p>
			<p>⛔ sketches (I only do fully colored artworks)</p>
			<p>⛔ imitation of someone else's style</p>
			<p>⛔ anything having to do with AI or NFT</p>
			<p>Everything else goes (most likely)</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>50% PAID</b> after the rough sketch is finished and agreed upon. The rest is paid before I send you a scan of the finished artwork. 
				Payments accepted only via this <a href="https://hipolink.me/mx.poesu">Hipolink page</a>. 
				Unfortunately I can't use any other platforms. Due to the same technical reasons refunds are not available.
				Don't send me the payment before I've requested you to do so. Otherwise I'll consider it a donation.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>REVISIONS:</b></p>
			<p>~ rough sketch: unlimited, if general idea doesn't change</p>
			<p>~ pencil lineart: 2 revisions for free, only insignificant edits allowed; for further revisions I'll charge from $1 depending on the amount of work needed</p>
			<p>~ colouring and acrylic lineart: not allowed, because edits at this stage are either too difficult, or impossible since I'm a traditional artist</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>SHIPPING</b> price is not included and may vary depending on your location and size of the artwork. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>COMMERCIAL USE</b> negotiable. By default no commercial use rights are given. 
				I retain all rights over the artwork, including the right to post it publicly. 
				I don't do private commissions that I'm not allowed to publish on my own, 
				but I can put the post on hold if your commission is a gift for someone. 
				You are free to post the final artwork publicly.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>NO GENERATIVE AI</b> used or will ever be used at any stage of my art process, 
			including conception, references, processing, etc. I will not accept AI 'art' as a reference picture. 
			I prohibit usage of my art in any proximity to generative AI and NFTs.<p>
