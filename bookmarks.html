				<h2 id="audiobooks">â—Š AUDIOBOOKS â—Š</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> 'Joyful' by Ingrid Fetell Lee. 
						It really sparks imagination and motivates to make the world around us more beautiful and joyful. 
						The books explores many different ways to do that, mostly in interior and design. 
						I was inspired to take on quite a few creative endeavors by this book.</li>
						
						<br>
						
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> 'How to Do Nothing' by Jenny Odell.
						This one challenges the notions of 'usefullness' and 'productivity'. 
						Useful for whom? Productive for what? I love how the author doesn't slide into 'self-care' realm 
						(yet another term appropriated by corporate greed) and instead explores how we could resist capitalism 
						by doing nothing to uphold it and thus living a more meaningful (joyful!) life. She proposes the necessity of missing out. 
						For me it was very therapeutic, I finally felt heard and understood.</li>
					</ul>

				<br><br>

				<h2 id="blogposts">â—Š BLOG POSTS â—Š</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> '<a href="https://aredridel.dinhe.net/2023/07/10/an-introverts-guide-to-social-media/">Less screaming into less void</a>' 
						by Aria Stewart. Great article about how expectations and goals can set us up for a failure. 
						It basically sums up my journey of trying to promote myself and always unsuccessfully. 
						Which is why I decided to join the IndieWebâ€”I now want to do something for myself and because it brings me joy.</li>
						
						<br>
						
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> '<a href="https://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/blogs/artists-notebook/posts/nsfw-on-the-indieweb">NSFW on the IndieWeb</a>' 
						by Paul Watson. I'm really looking forward to see more 'NSFW' art on the IndieWeb, 
						it holds such a great potential for long censored and devalued forms of art to thrive and be destigmatized, 
						especially for my fellow queer creators.</li>
					</ul>	
				

				<br><br>

				<h2 id="videos">â—Š VIDEOS â—Š</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> '<a href="https://youtu.be/DalnJ-isI5A">The World Is Not Ending</a>' by Sophie From Mars. 
						Explores how doomerism is basically capitalistic propaganda</li>
						
						<br>
						
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> '<a href="https://youtu.be/v5DqmTtCPiQ">Whoâ€™s Afraid of Modern Art: Vandalism, Video Games, and Fascism</a>' by Jacob Geller.</li>
						
						<br>
						
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> '<a href="https://youtu.be/QgDXMyAs-VY">In Defence of Walking Simulators</a>' by Pixel a Day.
						How 'walking simulators' is a form of art that challenges the norm.</li>
					</ul>
				

				<br><br>

				<h2 id="games">â—Š GAMES â—Š</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> 'Flower' by thatgamecompany. 
						What's amazes me the most about this game is that it doesn't even has a character.
						It kinda has 'The World Is Not Ending' vibe (see 'Videos' section), and made me more appreciative of, y'know, nature.</li>
						
						<br>
						
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> 'Journey' by thatgamecompany.
						Couldn't really comprehend what the story is about, it's more abstract than, say, 
						ABZÃ› that it often gets compared to in terms of the message. But still I felt a catharsis finishing this one.
						It makes me feel connected to the world around me and that my relationship with it is reciprocal</li>
						
						<br>
						
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> 'Dear Esther' by The Chinese Room. I loved untangling the story with bits
						and pieces of visual cues and narration. If you want to spend an evening sobbing (in a good way), this is the one.</li>
						
						<br>
						
						<li><span class="text-color-yellow">~</span> 'Dragon's Dogma' by Capcom. As you can already guess,
						I love just wandering around. No fighting, no interactions. You just appreciate serenity of the surrondings, nothing threatens you.
						'Dragon's Dogma' is an aRPG, but there's some charm to simply walking there along the shore or in the woods. It's long been my
						special interest, and the message helped me cope in my most difficult times. I ended up questioning that message and 
						some problematic stuff like racism and mysogyny, but I can find things to value about this game anyway. 
						Also you can create femboy characters. Yes. That's the most important thing.</li>
					</ul>
